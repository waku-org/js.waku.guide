Let\u0026rsquo;s start by sending simple strings as messages.\nTo send a message, you need to wrap the message in a WakuMessage. When using a basic string payload, you can use the WakuMessage.fromUtf8String helper:\nimport { WakuMessage } from \u0026#34;js-waku\u0026#34;; const wakuMessage = await WakuMessage.fromUtf8String( \u0026#34;Here is a message\u0026#34;, `/relay-guide/1/chat/proto` ); Then, use the relay module to send the message to our peers, the message will then be relayed to the rest of the network thanks to Waku Relay:\nawait waku.relay.send(wakuMessage); Use Protobuf #  Sending strings as messages in unlikely to cover your dApps needs.\nWaku v2 protocols use protobuf by default.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s review how you can use protobuf to include structured objects in Waku Messages.\nFirst, define a data structure. For this guide, we will use a simple chat message that contains a timestamp and text:\n{ timestamp: Date; text: string; } To encode and decode protobuf payloads, you can use the protons package.\nInstall Protobuf Library #  First, install protons:\nnpm install protons Protobuf Definition #  Then define the simple chat message:\nimport protons from \u0026#34;protons\u0026#34;; const proto = protons(` message SimpleChatMessage { uint64 timestamp = 1; string text = 2; } `); You can learn about protobuf message definitions here: Protocol Buffers Language Guide.\nEncode Messages #  Instead of wrapping an utf-8 string in a Waku Message, you are going to wrap a protobuf payload.\nFirst, encode the object:\nconst payload = proto.SimpleChatMessage.encode({ timestamp: Date.now(), text: \u0026#34;Here is a message\u0026#34;, }); Then, wrap it in a Waku Message:\nconst wakuMessage = await WakuMessage.fromBytes(payload, ContentTopic); Now, you can send the message over Waku Relay the same way than before:\nawait waku.relay.send(wakuMessage); Decode Messages #  To decode the messages received over Waku Relay, you need to extract the protobuf payload and decode it using protons.\nconst processIncomingMessage = (wakuMessage) =\u0026gt; { // No need to attempt to decode a message if the payload is absent  if (!wakuMessage.payload) return; const { timestamp, text } = proto.SimpleChatMessage.decode( wakuMessage.payload ); console.log(`Message Received: ${text}, sent at ${timestamp.toString()}`); }; Like before, add this callback as an observer to Waku Relay:\nwaku.relay.addObserver(processIncomingMessage, [\u0026#34;/relay-guide/1/chat/proto\u0026#34;]); Conclusion #  That is it! Now, you know how to send and receive messages over Waku using the Waku Relay protocol.\nHere is the final code:\nimport { getBootstrapNodes, Waku, WakuMessage } from \u0026#34;js-waku\u0026#34;; import protons from \u0026#34;protons\u0026#34;; const proto = protons(` message SimpleChatMessage { uint64 timestamp = 1; string text = 2; } `); const wakuNode = await Waku.create(); const nodes = await getBootstrapNodes(); await Promise.all(nodes.map((addr) =\u0026gt; waku.dial(addr))); const processIncomingMessage = (wakuMessage) =\u0026gt; { // No need to attempt to decode a message if the payload is absent  if (!wakuMessage.payload) return; const { timestamp, text } = proto.SimpleChatMessage.decode( wakuMessage.payload ); console.log(`Message Received: ${text}, sent at ${timestamp.toString()}`); }; waku.relay.addObserver(processIncomingMessage, [\u0026#34;/relay-guide/1/chat/proto\u0026#34;]); const payload = proto.SimpleChatMessage.encode({ timestamp: Date.now(), text: \u0026#34;Here is a message\u0026#34;, }); const wakuMessage = await WakuMessage.fromBytes(payload, ContentTopic); await waku.relay.send(wakuMessage); "},{"id":3,"href":"/docs/guides/03_store_retrieve_messages/","title":"Retrieve Messages Using Waku Store","section":"Guides","content":"Retrieve Messages Using Waku Store #  DApps running on a phone or in a browser are often offline: The browser could be closed or mobile app in the background.\nWaku Relay is a gossip protocol.

If you cannot be reached by your peers, then messages are not relayed; relay peers do not save messages for later.\nHowever, Waku Store peers do save messages they relay, allowing you to retrieve them at a later time. The Waku Store protocol is best-effort and does not guarantee data availability. Waku Relay should still be preferred when online; Waku Store can be used after resuming connectivity: For example, when the dApp starts.\nIn this guide, we\u0026rsquo;ll review how you can use Waku Store to retrieve messages.\nBefore starting, you need to choose a Content Topic for your dApp. Check out the how to choose a content topic guide to learn more about content topics.\nFor this guide, we are using a single content topic: /store-guide/1/news/proto.\nInstallation #  You can install js-waku using your favorite package manager:\nnpm install js-waku Create Waku Instance #  In order to interact with the Waku network, you first need a Waku instance:\nimport { Waku } from \u0026#34;js-waku\u0026#34;; const wakuNode = await Waku.create({ bootstrap: { default: true } }); Passing the bootstrap option will connect your node to predefined Waku nodes.

The WakuStore.queryHistory API automatically query all the pages in a sequential manner. To process messages as soon as they received (page by page), use the callback option:\nconst ContentTopic = \u0026#34;/store-guide/1/news/proto\u0026#34;; const callback = (retrievedMessages) =\u0026gt; { const articles = retrievedMessages .map(decodeWakuMessage) // Decode messages  .filter(Boolean); // Filter out undefined values  console.log(`${articles.length}articles have been retrieved`); }; waku.store.queryHistory([ContentTopic], { callback }).catch((e) =\u0026gt; { // Catch any potential error  console.log(\u0026#34;Failed to retrieve messages from store\u0026#34;, e); }); Note that WakuStore.queryHistory select an available store node for you. However, it can only select a connected node, which is why the bootstrapping is necessary. It will throw an error if no store node is available.\nFilter messages by send time #  By default, Waku Store nodes store messages for 30 days. Depending on your use case, you may not need to retrieve 30 days worth of messages.\nWaku Message defines an optional unencrypted timestamp field. The timestamp is set by the sender. By default, js-waku sets the timestamp of outgoing message to the current time.\nYou can filter messages that include a timestamp within given bounds with the timeFilter option.\nRetrieve messages up to a week old:\n// [..] `ContentTopic` and `callback` definitions  const startTime = new Date(); // 7 days/week, 24 hours/day, 60min/hour, 60secs/min, 100ms/sec startTime.setTime(startTime.getTime() - 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000); waku.store .queryHistory([ContentTopic], { callback, timeFilter: { startTime, endTime: new Date() }, }) .catch((e) =\u0026gt; { console.log(\u0026#34;Failed to retrieve messages from store\u0026#34;, e); }); End result #  You can see a similar example implemented in ReactJS in the Minimal ReactJS Waku Store App.\n"},{"id":4,"href":"/docs/guides/04_encrypt_messages_version_1/","title":"Encrypt Messages Using Waku Message Version 1","section":"Guides","content":"Encrypt Messages Using Waku Message Version 1 #  The Waku Message format provides an easy way to encrypt messages using symmetric or asymmetric encryption. The encryption comes with several handy design requirements: confidentiality, authenticity and integrity. It also allows the sender to sign messages, see Sign Messages Using Waku Message Version 1 to learn how.\nYou can find more details about Waku Message Payload Encryption in 26/WAKU-PAYLOAD.\nSee Cryptographic Libraries for more details on the cryptographic libraries used by js-waku.\nWhat data is encrypted #  With Waku Message Version 1, the entire payload is encrypted.\nWhich means that the only discriminating data available in clear text is the content topic and timestamp (if present). Hence, if Alice expects to receive messages under a given content topic, she needs to try to decrypt all messages received on said content topic.\nThis needs to be kept in mind for scalability and forward secrecy concerns:\n If there is high traffic on a given content topic then all clients need to process and attempt decryption of all messages with said content topic; If a content topic is only used by a given (group of) user(s) then it is possible to deduce some information about said user(s) communications such as sent time and frequency of messages.  Key management #  By using Waku Message Version 1, you will need to provide a way to your users to generate and store keys in a secure manner. Storing, backing up and recovering key is out of the scope of this guide.\nIf key recovery is important for your dApp, then check out SubtleCrypto.wrapKey() which can be used to securely store or export private keys.\nAn example to save and load a key pair in local storage, protected with a password, can be found in Eth-PM.\nWhich encryption method should I use? #  Whether you should use symmetric or asymmetric encryption depends on your use case.\nSymmetric encryption is done using a single key to encrypt and decrypt.\nWhich means that if Alice knows the symmetric key K and uses it to encrypt a message, she can also use K to decrypt any message encrypted with K, even if she is not the sender.\nGroup chats is a possible use case for symmetric encryption: All participants can use an out-of-band method to agree on a K. Participants can then use K to encrypt and decrypt messages within the group chat. Participants MUST keep K secret to ensure that no external party can decrypt the group chat messages.\nAsymmetric encryption is done using a key pair: the public key is used to encrypt messages, the matching private key is used to decrypt messages.\nFor Alice to encrypt a message for Bob, she needs to know Bob\u0026rsquo;s Public Key K. Bob can then use his private key k to decrypt the message. As long as Bob keep his private key k secret, then he, and only he, can decrypt messages encrypted with K.\nPrivate 1:1 messaging is a possible use case for asymmetric encryption: When Alice sends an encrypted message for Bob, only Bob can decrypt it.\nSymmetric Encryption #  Generate Key #  To use symmetric encryption, you first need to generate a key. Use generateSymmetricKey for secure key generation:\nimport { generateSymmetricKey } from \u0026#34;js-waku\u0026#34;; const symmetricKey = generateSymmetricKey(); Encrypt Message #  To encrypt a message with the previously generated key, pass the key in the symKey property to WakuMessage.fromBytes.\nSame as Waku Messages version 0 (unencrypted), payload is your message payload and contentTopic is the content topic for your dApp. See Receive and Send Messages Using Waku Relay for details.\nimport { WakuMessage } from \u0026#34;js-waku\u0026#34;; const message = await WakuMessage.fromBytes(payload, contentTopic, { symKey: symmetricKey, }); The Waku Message can then be sent to the Waku network using Waku Relay or Waku Light Push:\nawait waku.lightPush.push(message); Decrypt Messages #  To decrypt messages, whether they are received over Waku Relay or using Waku Store, add the symmetric key as a decryption key to your Waku instance.\nwaku.addDecryptionKey(symmetricKey); Alternatively, you can pass the key when creating the instance:\nimport { Waku } from \u0026#34;js-waku\u0026#34;; const waku = Waku.create({ decryptionKeys: [symmetricKey] }); It will attempt to decrypt any message it receives using the key, for both symmetric and asymmetric encryption.\nYou can call addDecryptionKey several times if you are using multiple keys, symmetric key and asymmetric private keys can be used together.\nMessages that are not successfully decrypted are dropped.\nAsymmetric Encryption #  Generate Key Pair #  To use asymmetric encryption, you first need to generate a private key and calculate the corresponding public key. Use generatePrivateKey for secure key generation:\nimport { generatePrivateKey, getPublicKey } from \u0026#34;js-waku\u0026#34;; const privateKey = generatePrivateKey(); const publicKey = getPublicKey(privateKey); The private key must be securely stored and remain private. If leaked then other parties may be able to decrypt the user\u0026rsquo;s messages.\nThe public key is unique for a given private key and can always be recovered given the private key, hence it is not needed to save it as long as as the private key can be recovered.\nEncrypt Message #  The public key is used to encrypt messages; to do so, pass it in the encPublicKey property to WakuMessage.fromBytes.\nSame as clear Waku Messages, payload is your message payload and contentTopic is the content topic for your dApp. See Receive and Send Messages Using Waku Relay for details.\nimport { WakuMessage } from \u0026#34;js-waku\u0026#34;; const message = await WakuMessage.fromBytes(payload, contentTopic, { encPublicKey: publicKey, }); The Waku Message can then be sent to the Waku network using Waku Relay or Waku Light Push:\nawait waku.lightPush.push(message); Decrypt Messages #  The private key is needed to decrypt messages.\nTo decrypt messages, whether they are received over Waku Relay or using Waku Store, add the private key as a decryption key to your Waku instance.\nwaku.addDecryptionKey(privateKey); Alternatively, you can pass the key when creating the instance:\nimport { Waku } from \u0026#34;js-waku\u0026#34;; const waku = Waku.create({ decryptionKeys: [privateKey] }); It will attempt to decrypt any message it receives using the key, for both symmetric and asymmetric encryption.\nYou can call addDecryptionKey several times if you are using multiple keys, symmetric key and asymmetric private keys can be used together.\nMessages that are not successfully decrypted are dropped.\nHandling WakuMessage instances #  When creating a Waku Message using WakuMessage.fromBytes with an encryption key (symmetric or asymmetric), the payload gets encrypted. Which means that wakuMessage.payload returns an encrypted payload:\nimport { WakuMessage } from \u0026#34;js-waku\u0026#34;; const message = await WakuMessage.fromBytes(payload, contentTopic, { encPublicKey: publicKey, }); console.log(message.payload); // This is encrypted However, WakuMessage instances returned by WakuRelay or WakuStore are always decrypted.\nWakuRelay and WakuStore never return messages that are encrypted. If a message was not successfully decrypted, then it will be dropped from the results.\nWhich means that WakuMessage instances returned by WakuRelay and WakuStore always have a clear payload (in regard to Waku Message version 1):\nimport { Waku } from \u0026#34;js-waku\u0026#34;; const waku = Waku.create({ decryptionKeys: [privateKey] }); const messages = await waku.store.queryHistory([contentTopic]); if (messages \u0026amp;\u0026amp; messages[0]) { console.log(messages[0].payload); // This payload is decrypted } waku.relay.addObserver( (message) =\u0026gt; { console.log(message.payload); // This payload is decrypted  }, [contentTopic] ); Code Example #  The Eth-PM Web App example demonstrates both the use of symmetric and asymmetric encryption.\nAsymmetric encryption is used for private messages so that only the intended recipient can read said messages.\nSymmetric encryption is used for the public key messages. In this instance, the same key is used for all users: the Keccak-256 hash of the content topic (which results in 32 bytes array). While this does not add functional value, it does demonstrate the usage of symmetric encryption in a web app.\nA live version of Eth-PM can be found at https://status-im.github.io/js-waku/eth-pm/.\nThe specifications of the protocol it implements can be found at 20/TOY-ETH-PM.\n"},{"id":5,"href":"/docs/guides/05_sign_messages_version_1/","title":"Sign Messages Using Waku Message Version 1","section":"Guides","content":"Sign Messages Using Waku Message Version 1 #  The Waku Message format provides an easy way to sign messages using elliptic curve cryptography.\nIt also allows the sender to encrypt messages, see Encrypt Messages Using Waku Message Version 1 to learn how.\nYou can find more details about Waku Message Payload Signature in 26/WAKU-PAYLOAD.\nSee Cryptographic Libraries for more details on the cryptographic libraries used by js-waku.\nCreate new keypair #  Generate a new keypair to sign your messages:\nimport { generatePrivateKey, getPublicKey } from \u0026#34;js-waku\u0026#34;; const privateKey = generatePrivateKey(); const publicKey = getPublicKey(privateKey); Sign Waku Messages #  As per version 1\u0026rsquo;s specs, signatures are only included in encrypted messages.

In this guide, we will demonstrate how your ReactJS dApp can use Waku Store to retrieve messages.\nDApps running on a phone or in a browser are often offline: The browser could be closed or mobile app in the background.\nWaku Relay is a gossip protocol. As a user, it means that your peers forward you messages they just received. If you cannot be reached by your peers, then messages are not relayed; relay peers do not save messages for later.\nHowever, Waku Store peers do save messages they relay, allowing you to retrieve them at a later time. The Waku Store protocol is best-effort and does not guarantee data availability. Waku Relay should still be preferred when online; Waku Store can be used after resuming connectivity: For example, when the dApp starts.\nIn this guide, we\u0026rsquo;ll review how you can use Waku Store to retrieve messages.\nBefore starting, you need to choose a Content Topic for your dApp. Check out the how to choose a content topic guide to learn more about content topics.\nSetup #  Create a new React app:\nnpx create-react-app store-reactjs-chat cd store-reactjs-chat BigInt #  Some of js-waku\u0026rsquo;s dependencies use BigInt that is only supported by modern browsers.\nTo ensure that react-scripts properly transpile your webapp code, update the package.json file:\n{ \u0026#34;browserslist\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;production\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;\u0026gt;0.2%\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;not ie \u0026lt;= 99\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;not android \u0026lt;= 4.4.4\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;not dead\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;not op_mini all\u0026#34; ] } } Setup polyfills #  A number of Web3 dependencies need polyfills.

The API provided by js-waku automatically traverses all pages of the Waku Store response. By default, the most recent page is retrieved first but this can be changed with the pageDirection option.\nFirst, define a React state to save the messages:\nfunction App() { const [messages, setMessages] = React.useState([]); /// [..] } Then, define processMessages to decode and then store messages in the React state. You will pass processMessages as a callback option to WakuStore.queryHistory. processMessages will be called each time a page is received from the Waku Store.\nconst processMessages = (retrievedMessages) =\u0026gt; { const messages = retrievedMessages.map(decodeMessage).filter(Boolean); setMessages((currentMessages) =\u0026gt; { return currentMessages.concat(messages.reverse()); }); }; Pass processMessage in WakuStore.queryHistory as the callback value:\nwaku.store.queryHistory([ContentTopic], { callback: processMessages }); Finally, create a Messages component to render the messages:\nfunction Messages(props) { return props.messages.map(({ text, timestamp, nick }) =\u0026gt; { return ( \u0026lt;li\u0026gt; ({formatDate(timestamp)}) {nick}: {text} \u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; ); }); } function formatDate(timestamp) { return timestamp.toLocaleString([], { month: \u0026#34;short\u0026#34;, day: \u0026#34;numeric\u0026#34;, hour: \u0026#34;numeric\u0026#34;, minute: \u0026#34;2-digit\u0026#34;, second: \u0026#34;2-digit\u0026#34;, hour12: false, }); } Use Messages in the App function:\nfunction App() { // [..]  return ( \u0026lt;div className=\u0026#34;App\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;header className=\u0026#34;App-header\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;{wakuStatus}\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h3\u0026gt;Messages\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt; \u0026lt;ul\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Messages messages={messages} /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/header\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); } All together, you should now have:\nimport { Waku } from \u0026#34;js-waku\u0026#34;; import * as React from \u0026#34;react\u0026#34;; import protons from \u0026#34;protons\u0026#34;; const ContentTopic = \u0026#34;/toy-chat/2/huilong/proto\u0026#34;; const proto = protons(` message ChatMessage { uint64 timestamp = 1; string nick = 2; bytes text = 3; } `); function App() { const [waku, setWaku] = React.useState(undefined); const [wakuStatus, setWakuStatus] = React.useState(\u0026#34;None\u0026#34;); const [messages, setMessages] = React.useState([]); // Start Waku  React.useEffect(() =\u0026gt; { // If Waku status not None, it means we are already starting Waku  if (wakuStatus !== \u0026#34;None\u0026#34;) return; setWakuStatus(\u0026#34;Starting\u0026#34;); // Create Waku  Waku.create({ bootstrap: { default: true } }).then((waku) =\u0026gt; { // Once done, put it in the state  setWaku(waku); // And update the status  setWakuStatus(\u0026#34;Connecting\u0026#34;); }); }, [waku, wakuStatus]); React.useEffect(() =\u0026gt; { if (!waku) return; if (wakuStatus === \u0026#34;Connected\u0026#34;) return; waku.waitForConnectedPeer().then(() =\u0026gt; { setWakuStatus(\u0026#34;Connected\u0026#34;); }); }, [waku, wakuStatus]); React.useEffect(() =\u0026gt; { if (wakuStatus !== \u0026#34;Connected\u0026#34;) return; const processMessages = (retrievedMessages) =\u0026gt; { const messages = retrievedMessages.map(decodeMessage).filter(Boolean); setMessages((currentMessages) =\u0026gt; { return currentMessages.concat(messages.reverse()); }); }; waku.store .queryHistory([ContentTopic], { callback: processMessages }) .catch((e) =\u0026gt; { console.log(\u0026#34;Failed to retrieve messages\u0026#34;, e); }); }, [waku, wakuStatus]); return ( \u0026lt;div className=\u0026#34;App\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;header className=\u0026#34;App-header\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;{wakuStatus}\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h3\u0026gt;Messages\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt; \u0026lt;ul\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Messages messages={messages} /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/header\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); } export default App; function decodeMessage(wakuMessage) { if (!wakuMessage.payload) return; const { timestamp, nick, text } = proto.ChatMessage.decode( wakuMessage.payload ); // All fields in protobuf are optional so be sure to check  if (!timestamp || !text || !nick) return; const time = new Date(); time.setTime(timestamp); const utf8Text = Buffer.from(text).toString(\u0026#34;utf-8\u0026#34;); return { text: utf8Text, timestamp: time, nick }; } function Messages(props) { return props.messages.map(({ text, timestamp, nick }) =\u0026gt; { return ( \u0026lt;li\u0026gt; ({formatDate(timestamp)}) {nick}: {text} \u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; ); }); } function formatDate(timestamp) { return timestamp.toLocaleString([], { month: \u0026#34;short\u0026#34;, day: \u0026#34;numeric\u0026#34;, hour: \u0026#34;numeric\u0026#34;, minute: \u0026#34;2-digit\u0026#34;, second: \u0026#34;2-digit\u0026#34;, hour12: false, }); } Note that WakuStore.queryHistory select an available store node for you. However, it can only select a connected node, which is why the bootstrapping is necessary. It will throw an error if no store node is available.\nIf no message are returned, then you can use https://status-im.github.io/js-waku/ to send some messages on the toy chat topic and refresh your app.\nFilter messages by send time #  By default, Waku Store nodes store messages for 30 days. Depending on your use case, you may not need to retrieve 30 days worth of messages.\nWaku Message defines an optional unencrypted timestamp field. The timestamp is set by the sender. By default, js-waku sets the timestamp of outgoing message to the current time.\nYou can filter messages that include a timestamp within given bounds with the timeFilter option.\nRetrieve messages up to a week old:\nconst startTime = new Date(); // 7 days/week, 24 hours/day, 60min/hour, 60secs/min, 100ms/sec startTime.setTime(startTime.getTime() - 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000); waku.store.queryHistory([ContentTopic], { callback: processMessages, timeFilter: { startTime, endTime: new Date() }, }); End result #  You can see the complete code in the Minimal ReactJS Waku Store App.\n"},{"id":9,"href":"/docs/guides/09_debug/","title":"How to Debug your Waku dApp","section":"Guides","content":"How to Debug your Waku dApp #  JS-Waku and its most relevant dependencies (libp2p) uses debug to handle logs.\nNodeJS #  To enable debug logs when running js-waku with NodeJS, simply set the DEBUG environment variable.\nTo only enable js-waku debug logs:\nexport DEBUG=waku* To enable js-waku and libp2p debug logs:\nexport DEBUG=waku*,libp2p* To enable all debug logs:\nexport DEBUG=* Browser #  To see the debug logs in your browser\u0026rsquo;s console, you need to modify the local storage and add debug key.\nHere are guides for some modern browsers:\n Firefox Chrome     key value effect     debug waku* enable js-waku debug logs   debug waku*,libp2p* enable js-waku and libp2p debug logs   debug * enable all debug logs    "},{"id":10,"href":"/docs/introduction/","title":"Introduction","section":"Introduction","content":"Waku Connect Docs #  Waku Connect is a suite of libraries, SDKs and documentations to help you use Waku in your dApp.\nWaku is a decentralized, censorship-resistant, network and protocol family.

The polls are not committed to the blockchain and hence do not cost gas.\nAs the polls use Waku, they do maintain properties expected from dApps: decentralized and censorship-resistant.\nThe high-level functionality is as follows:\n To create a poll, a token holder sends a message with the poll questions, possible answers and an end time over Waku, Other users receive the poll creation message and can view the poll,  To avoid spam, only polls created by actual token holders are displayed,   Any token holder can send their poll answer over Waku, Each user cumulates poll responses from Waku and can view them,  To avoid spam, only responses sent by actual token holders are displayed.
